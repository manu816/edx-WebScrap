Evenly distributed among the periods into which his life and work are customarily divided, his 16 quartets offer a broadly representative record of his changing musical language. The six quartets of the first period follow closely in the footsteps of Beethoven's teacher Haydn, the acknowledged “father"" of the genre; the five quartets of the middle period significantly expand musical form as well as the range of dramatic expression; the remaining five quartets, written in the composer's idiosyncratic ""late style,"" take the genre to unheard-of levels of innovation.","Estimated 7 weeks","3–6 hours per week","Self-paced","Language:","Video Transcript:  English","Level:  Introductory","MX$1,024","Free"

Medical education in most countries however, focuses on approaching patients in a methodical, time intensive manner.

The specialty of Emergency Medicine (EM) centers on rapidly sorting, assessing, and stabilizing undifferentiated patients regardless of the etiology of their condition.

Nuclear weapons may seem like 20th century history, but the choices we make about these weapons in the 21st century will decide your future in truly fundamental ways. Because most people do not understand just how serious these dangers are today, their governments are not taking adequate preventive actions: actions that are readily achievable. And so, we are drifting towards a nuclear catastrophe. This is why I have dedicated the balance of my life to educate the public about these dangers, and this is the reason I have created this course. I have been joined in this effort by an outstanding and uniquely qualified group of educators and public servants who share my concerns about nuclear weapons.","Estimated 10 weeks","1–4 hours per week","Self-paced","Language:","Video Transcript:  English","Level:  Introductory","MX$1,024","Free"
